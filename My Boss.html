            When life doesn't give you what you want, do you feel it is an end of everything?  May be it is the time to take another direction.
            There are times in our lives when our best efforts don't give us the results we want. At that time, we feel so broken that we feel there is nothing left in life. We feel so helpless that all we do is just doubt ourselves. It does hurt when we don't see the rewards of our efforts but once we understand the true meaning of success,Wikipedia is not a reliable source for citations elsewhere on Wikipedia. Because it can be edited by anyone at any time, any information it contains at a particular time could be vandalism, a work in progress, or just plain wrong. ... Therefore, Wikipedia should not be considered a definitive source in and of itself.</p>
